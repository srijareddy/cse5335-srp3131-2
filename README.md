#Cse 5335 Project-2
##Readme

### What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
The project was not easy to work on and consumed a lot of time in understanding the technologies used. But once we understand them,
it was easy to work on the tasks.

### What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Connecting to the database was a big challenge for me. It took a lot of time for me to understand and correct my mistakes
as I have never worked with any of the mentioned data storage tools earlier.

### If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
I have used MongoDb in my project.And the little research I did showed that there are a few facts about MongoDb
that might be of concern when dealing with it. Few of them are:
-It might lose data
-It does not comply to the ACID properties
-Scalability and maintenance is difficult
